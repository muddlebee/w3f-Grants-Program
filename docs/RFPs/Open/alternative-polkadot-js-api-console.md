## Current state
We have a Javascript console at the Developer tab which is really useful for running polkadot js API scripts [https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/cookbook/blocks](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/cookbook/blocks)

**Current limitations of the above console**
Cannot save code properly, not much keyboard shortcuts, cannot customize configurations.

**Alternative polkadot js API playground**

## Proposed RFP

A new javascript playground with vs-code like configurations like save the code, workspace, keyboard shortcuts etc etc..
[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/js)

some examples -> https://playground.substrate.dev/
here we have to manually build and run our js bundles

**Why alternative javascript console for for polkadot js API**

Current polkadot js API console which I mentioned in beginning of this post, has some limitations, which we can overcome by creating a better version for smoother dev experience.
